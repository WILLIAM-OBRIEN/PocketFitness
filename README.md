William and Daniel's health app.

Health app with 4 functionalities: 

1. Calorie Calculator

  that they might do. The user's name is also inputted so as to be used later in the calorie tracker.

2. Pedometer 
  Functioning pedometer that measures user's steps. Does NOT work on android emualtion as it doesn't have a sensor, but does work on 
  Huawei P9.
  
3. BMI calculator
  Calculates users BMI (body mass index) which is a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height. It also gives you
  health tips for general welll being.

4. Calorie Tracker
  Allows for the user's to keep a tab on their daily calorie usage, as well as if they have exceded their calculated daily calorie usage, 
  (either a default value of 2200 or the calcualtion from Calorie Calculator).
  
  We found using android studio to be frustrating sometimes with it's slow startup, laggy emulations for phones and sometimes the GUI 
  wasn't representative of the actual displayed application. The project was however a great learning experience for understanding the 
  android development process and the teamwork required for the project aswell.
